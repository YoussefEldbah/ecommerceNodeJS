# E-Commerce Backend API

This repository contains the backend code for an e-commerce platform, providing user authentication, product management, cart functionality, order processing, and more. Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this API is designed to handle essential e-commerce operations efficiently and securely.

## Features

* **User Authentication & Role-Based Access:**
  Register, login, and manage users with secure password hashing and JWT authentication. Supports both `admin` and `user` roles.

* **Password Recovery:**
  Secure password reset via email with token expiration and a one-time link for resetting the password.

* **Product Management:**
  CRUD operations for managing products, including product details like title, price, category, and stock.

* **Category Management:**
  Create, read, and manage product categories.

* **Shopping Cart Management:**
  Add, remove, and view products in the cart. Cart is tied to each user, and quantities are updated accordingly.

  Create and update orders, including stock updates when an order is placed. Admin can change order status to track the progress of orders.

* **Email Integration:**
  Sends email notifications for password resets and other user-related actions using Nodemailer.
